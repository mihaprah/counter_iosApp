  A simple app for keeping count upon every click.
</p>


## Description
It is a simple app for keeping the count for you when you have other things to think about or you have to focus on something else and keeping in mind of some number represents just another problem. It was a great first project for getting started with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). 

## Functionalities
- Adding 1, 10 or a custom value to the count
- Subtracting 1, 10 or a custom value from the count
- Reseting the count back to the 0

The Counter app alows you to add or subtract the values of 1 or 10, by pressing the green button for adding to count and the red one for subtracting from it. If you want to have a custom value, you can the it's value in the settings, on the top right. After you are done or if you want to start the count again, you press the `Reset` button to set the count to 0.
